## Variables
<b> features </b><br> - A list of 561 features mentioned in `features.txt` file.<br><br>
<b> x_test </b><br> - A data frame which contains the data in `X_test.txt` which has 2947 observations of 561 variables.<br><br>
<b> x_train </b><br> - A data frame which contains the data in `X_train.txt`  which has 7352 observations of 561 variables.<br><br>
<b> data_x </b><br> - A data frame which contains the data in `x_test` and `x_train` merged by `rbind()` which has 10299 observations of 561 variables.<br><br>
<b> y_test </b><br> - A data frame which contains the data in `Y_test.txt`  which has 2947 observations of 1 variable.<br><br>
<b> y_train </b><br> - A data frame which contains the data in `Y_train.txt`  which has 7352 observations of 1 variable.<br><br>
<b> data_y </b><br> - A data frame which contains the data in `y_test` and `y_train` merged by `rbind()` which has 10299 observations of 1 variable.<br><br>
<b> sub_test </b><br> - A data frame which contains the data in `subject_test.txt` which has 2947 observations of 1 variable.<br><br>
<b> sub_train </b><br> - A data frame which contains the data in `subject_train.txt`  which has 7352 observations of 1 variable.<br><br>
<b> data_sub </b><br> - A data frame which contains the data in `sub_test` and `sub_train` merged by `rbind()` which has 10299 observations of 1 variable.<br><br>
<b> data </b><br> - A data frame which contains the data in `data_y`,`data_sub` and `data_x`  which has 10299 observations of 563 variables.<br><br>

<b> to_analyse </b><br> - A data frame which is obtained by subsetting the data from `data` which has only activity, subjecct and measurments of mean and standrad deviation of 10299 observations and 66 variables.<br><br>

<b> ordered_data </b><br> - A list which is obtained by splitting the data in `to_analyse` based on `Activity` and `Subject` columns.<br><br>

<b> means </b><br> - A list which has average of each variable for each activity and each subject, which can be accessed by `means$<ACTIVITY_NAME>.<SUBJECT_NUMBER>`<br><br>

## Generated Files

1. `tidydata.txt` is generated by using `write.table()` which has the data of `data` variable seperated by `tab` delimiter.<br>
2. `average.xlsx` contains the data about means of each variable for each activity and each subject. This file has 64 rows which represent the variables and 180 columns which represents activity and subject named as `<ACTIVITY_NAME>.<SUBJECT_NUMBER>`<br><br>
